# ExploitEclipse

This Python script is designed to automate the process of launching exploits against vulnerable targets. It leverages the `socket`, `subprocess`, and `os` modules to scan targets, generate payloads, and launch exploits.

## Features

- **Exploit Database**: Includes a predefined dictionary of exploits with details such as vulnerability, target OS, architecture, and payload.
- **Target Scanning**: Checks if the target is vulnerable to a specific exploit.
- **Payload Generation**: Automatically generates payloads based on the selected exploit.
- **Exploit Launching**: Executes the generated payload to launch the selected exploit against the target.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sftp-nik/ExploitEclipse.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ExploitEclipse
   ```


3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the target IP address and port.
